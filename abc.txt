Starting with the first topic-challenging project that i had undertook and overcomed

IN final year of college we had to present a group project and
we were randomly assigned different group of peoples as team members.
 as i was managing team
the very first challenge was to decide a project domain and topic so that every
member in the group will be comfortable working on it as every member was 
new to each other and following different technology. 
finally we decided to take machine learning as 
a domain and project topic was nework trafiic analysis with ml algorithm
also many other technologies were involved in it 
 managing team with 
different technology was bit diffuclt

Technical challenges arose during implementaion 
phase we were short in dataset as ML need very large number of dataset
and the attacks we were detecting was not available in the dataset
but team continuosly conducted reaserches cosulted
various documents and taken advices from experienced peoples and mentors
we had given best in our areas that were known to us 
 this collaborative 
problem solving approch helped us overcome technical issue and ensure project 
progress and lead us to learning new skills from other members and also teching the skills
 to others
 another challenge was deadlines this project was part of our academics so we
had to manage this with studies and exams
 so we distributed equal work to every 
member about presentation and making journal with implementation.
there was certain communication gap at starting but  collaborative efforts toward 
the project made that project a success
